## Pitch

Let's give our company the reputation of best-in-class coaching. We have many (many) talented leaders, yet the "advice monster" runs rampant. This course will teach the coaching habits we need to build that reputation, and provide the space and community to develop those habits.

## Target audience

It'll be most valuable for mentors and leaders (managers, tech leads, etc.), although anyone who works with people could benefit.

Caveat: attendees must be committed to participating and must be there voluntarily. This course series will not work well if people are mandated to attend.

## Overview

The course will last 8 weeks and will be based around reading and practicing the lessons from [The Coaching Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749). Think of it like equal parts book club and group training/accountability. 

There are three components:

* Weekly one-hour synchronous workshop with the cohort (see agenda below)
* Dedicated cohort-specific slack channel for async discussion and check-ins
* Daily practice of the habits during normal daily work, which will be discussed at the workshop

Each cohort should ideally include 4-6 people (including the facilitator) to keep engagement and psychological safety high.

## Weekly workshop

Each week the cohort will meet for a 1-hour workshop with the following agenda:

* (20 mins) How did it go? - Discuss how practicing last week's habit went throughout the week, when we used it, whether it was effective, and what was challenging about it.
* (15 mins) Read the next section - Everyone goes to their book and reads the next planned section. This fixes the "I didn't have time to read" problem.
* (15 mins) How will we practice over the next week? - Discuss how and when we plan to practice our new habits before the next workshop. Questions or concerns about the habit we just read about can come up here.
* (5 mins) Us the new habit formula (below) to document habit changes we will try.
   ```
      When _____, 
      instead of _____, 
      I will _____.
   ```
## Asynchronous Channel

Each cohort should also have an asynchronous channel for discussion and shoutouts. Something along the lines of a slack channel works best. It is recommended to use tooling that the cohort is already using.

## Schedule (one chapter per week)

* Week 1: Introduction
  * Master Class 1: Ask One Question at a Time
* Week 2: "What's on your mind?"
  * Master Class 2: Cut the intro and Ask the Questions
* Week 3: "And what else?"
  * Master Class 3: Don't Ask Rhetorical Questions
* Week 4: "What's the real challenge here for you?"
  * Master Class 4: Stick to the questions: Starting with What
* Week 5: "What do you (really) want (from me)?"
  * Master Class 5: Get Comfortable with Silence
* Week 6: "How can I help?"
  * Master Class 6: Actually Listen to the Answer
* Week 7: "If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?"
  * Master Class 7: Acknowledge the Answer you get
* Week 8: "What was most useful for you?"
  * Master Class 8: Use Every Channel to Ask a Question

## Risks and open questions

* How do we measure success? The course won't be cheap (8 one-hour meetings per attendee, plus any non-meeting time), so how do we prove its worth?
* Will the actual coaching conversations people have as practice be too private/confidential to be discussed openly to the rest of the cohort?
* Is one week long enough to practice each new habit for everyone? Will that be long enough to generate discussion about how it went?
* Leaders have full calendars. Can we find the time for a weekly one-hour workshop consistently for everyone in the cohort?
